  <p>hello! i'm zeyna, a second year computational media major at georgia tech in atlanta. i'm not sure what path i'm taking yet, but i know that
    throughout my life, different forms of digital media have allowed me to dream bigger. video games, art, and music have made my life so much more fun, 
  enriching, and fulfilling. i hope that i'll be able to give give someone those same dreams, in whatever path i take :) </p>
  <p> in my free time, i love to learn foreign languages (currently studying japanese @ school, i've studied spanish and mandarin, and grew up speaking arabic), doodle, and play video games.
     i'm a big genshin impact enthusiast but my all-time favorite games are nier automata, horizon zero dawn, and skyrim :D </p>
