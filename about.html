  <h1>I'm Zeyna, an aspiring designer based in <b>Atlanta</b>, Georgia. </h1>
  <p> As a student studying Computer Science & Design, I've had the opportunity to learn about both designing and developing software.
  Through supporting community outreach initiatives and volunteering for non-profit organizations, I've developed an interest in using
  my skills in technology to promote social good.
