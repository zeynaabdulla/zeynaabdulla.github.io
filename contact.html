  <p><pre>last spring, i worked with a team to create an app concept
  for Urban Recipe, an Atlanta-based organization that provides co-op programs to those
  in need of food. This app would allow members of Urban Recipe's
  co-op program to receive nutrional counsel by suggesting healthy recipes 
  based on the items in the user's virtual pantry.
