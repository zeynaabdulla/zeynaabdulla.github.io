    <p> <i>wellbean</i> is an idea for a wellness app that allows students to keep track of their
        mental health and encourage good habits. The app's mascot, Bean, encourages
        users to have a daily "conversation" with him about their activities and feelings, which is logged
        in their virtual journal. These conversations can later be viewed and reflected upon. </p>

    <p> Visually, my team and I chose a pastel theme in order to create a calming and welcoming atmosphere.
We knew it was important for users to feel comforted by the app rather than intimidated by the 
prospect of using a mental health app. Other main features of wellbean include:</p>
<br>
  <li> <b> 1. Data charts that users can toggle on/off to view their progress.  </b>  </li>
     <p>From our user interviews, we noticed two distinct patterns: one group found that seeing visual representations of their patterns helped them, while the other group felt stressed out by seeing their data displayed in front of them. Since a top
    priority of this application is the mental comfort of users, we decided it would be best to allow users <em> the option</em> to see their data visually represented, while not forcing them into one option or the other. </p>
  <li> <b> 2. A virtual shop that users can purchase from by using Beanpoints! This virtual currency can be earned by logging into the app and
    having daily conversations with Bean. </b> </li>
    <p> From preliminary user research, we also discovered the importance of customization. Mental health is deeply personal, and each person has different habits, priorities, and wants when it comes to tools for mental health. Though this is 
      a mostly visual way of customization, we thought it would be beneficial to let users to interact with a virtual shop interface to not only allow for greater app customization, but to provide another incentive for users to log into the app and talk to Beanâ€” making him look cute! </p>
