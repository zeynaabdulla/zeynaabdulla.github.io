    <p> <i>wellbean</i> is an idea for a wellness app that allows students to keep track of their
        mental health and encourage good habits. The app's mascot, Bean, encourages
        users to have a daily "conversation" with him about their activities and feelings, which is logged
        in their virtual journal. These conversations can later be viewed and reflected upon. </p>

    <p> Visually, my partner and I chose a pastel theme in order to create a calming and welcoming atmosphere.
We also thought that a cute mascot such as bean would allow users to feel comforted by the app rather than
intimidated, since the goal of this app of promoting good habits related to mental health. </p>
