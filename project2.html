    <h1> <i>Urban Recipe Mobile App:</i> Spring 2021 </h1>

    <p> This application concept seeks to tackle the lack of nutritional counsel on the existing Urban Recipe (UR) 
    platform for those in the underserved Atlanta community.
    We identified constraints and limitations such as time, finances, and outreach as potential factors that prevent
    individuals from accessing nutrition initiatives.
    As Urban Recipe currently does not offer instructional healthy initiatives, individuals do not 
    have access to sufficient resources that promote nutrition and provide nutritional support. This app seeks to mitigate this issue by 
    offering functions such as recipe builders, recipe instructions and nutritional information, and a mobile pantry that users can track their
    food items on. </p>

    <p> We identified our problem space as a lack of nutritional services and counsel within Urban Recipe’s platform. Our solution space was an accessible platform to provide users healthy meal prep and nutritional help. 
        Our design was created with these requirements in mind— we created a mobile application that is meant to be easily accessible, increase nutritional literacy, and contain information on healthy meal preparation.
