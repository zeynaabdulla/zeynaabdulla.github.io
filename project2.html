    This application concept seeks to tackle the lack of nutritional counsel on the existing Urban Recipe (UR) platform for those in the underserved Atlanta community. 
    We identified constraints and limitations such as time, finances, and outreach as potential factors that prevent individuals from accessing nutrition initiatives.
    As Urban Recipe currently does not offer instructional healthy initiatives, individuals do not have access to sufficient resources that promote nutrition and provide nutritional support.
    This app concept seeks to mitigate this issue by offering functions such as recipe building, access to recipe instructions and nutritional information, and a mobile pantry that allows users to track their food items.

  <p> We identified our problem space as a lack of nutritional services and counsel within Urban Recipe’s platform. Our solution space was an accessible platform to provide users healthy meal prep and nutritional help. 
      Our design was created with these requirements in mind— we created a mobile application that is meant to be easily accessible, increase nutritional literacy, and contain information on healthy meal preparation.
